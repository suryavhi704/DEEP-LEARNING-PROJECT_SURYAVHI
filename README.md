# ✅ 📌 Project Title:
🔍 Deep Learning for Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom using ANN & Hyperparameter Optimization

🧠 Project Description:
I recently completed an end-to-end deep learning project focused on customer churn prediction using a real-world telecom dataset. The goal was to accurately identify customers who are likely to discontinue their telecom service.

# 📌 Key Highlights:

📂 Explored a high-dimensional telecom dataset with numerous customer features like service usage, account length, contract type, and charges.

🧼 Performed robust data preprocessing and feature engineering to handle missing values, encoding, and scaling.

🧠 Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and improve learning efficiency.

🏗️ Built a Deep Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Keras & TensorFlow with multiple hidden layers.

⚙️ Faced low accuracy initially; hence implemented RandomizedSearchCV with Scikeras wrapper to optimize hidden layer node sizes, batch size, and epochs.

🔁 Incorporated early stopping and cross-validation to avoid overfitting and ensure generalization.

📊 Final model achieved a significant boost in accuracy, with strong performance on the test data using metrics like confusion matrix and ROC AUC Score.

# 🚀 Technologies & Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Scikeras, RandomizedSearchCV, PCA


# 💡 What I Learned:
This project deepened my understanding of how hyperparameter tuning and model architecture influence deep learning performance — a great real-world lesson in scalable model design and optimization.
