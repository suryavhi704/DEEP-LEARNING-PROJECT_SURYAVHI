# 🧠 Project Title:
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning (CNN + MNIST)

# 🚀 Project Description:
In this project, I designed and built a deep learning-based digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset — a classic benchmark for handwritten digit classification. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model was trained to accurately identify digits from 0 to 9.

✅ After achieving strong performance on validation data, I took it one step further: I tested the model with a real-world image of the handwritten digit "5" that I drew myself or sourced externally. The model confidently predicted it correctly, proving its ability to generalize beyond training data.

# 🔍 Key Features:
📚 Trained a CNN architecture on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images).

🔄 Applied preprocessing: grayscale conversion, image inversion, normalization, and reshaping.

💡 Built an external image prediction pipeline using PIL and NumPy for real-time testing.

🧪 Model successfully identified digit "5" from an uploaded image, confirming external accuracy.

💾 Implemented model saving and reloading using TensorFlow for deployment use cases.

# 🛠 Tech Stack:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL (Image Processing)
Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits

# 🎯 What This Project Showcases:
This project highlights my knowledge of CNN architecture, model deployment, and the ability to handle real-world input — proving that my models don't just work in theory, but can be applied in practice.
