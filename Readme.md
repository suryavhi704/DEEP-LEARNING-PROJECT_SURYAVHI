# 👗 Project Title:
Fashion Item Recognition using CNN (Deep Learning on Fashion MNIST)

# 🚀 Project Overview:
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify fashion apparel using the Fashion MNIST dataset, a modern alternative to digit recognition tasks. This dataset contains grayscale images of 10 clothing categories like shirts, sneakers, trousers, bags, and more.

After training the CNN with high accuracy, I tested the model on external grayscale fashion images — including a T-shirt image — and the model confidently predicted the correct label. This demonstrated the model's ability to perform well on real-world, unseen data.

# 🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ Trained a robust CNN on 60,000 training samples from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

✅ Implemented data preprocessing steps: grayscale normalization, reshaping, and one-hot encoding.

✅ Built an external image prediction pipeline using PIL and NumPy to feed real T-shirt images into the model.

✅ Successfully predicted a T-shirt from an external input image with high confidence.

✅ Used Matplotlib for visual display of the prediction and confidence overlay.

✅ Saved the model using Keras and reloaded it for real-time predictions, simulating a deployed environment.

# 🛠 Tech Stack:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL
Dataset: Fashion MNIST (60,000 train, 10,000 test)
Model: Deep Learning CNN for Image Classification

# 🎯 Outcome:
This project highlights my ability to combine deep learning with real-world testing, building intelligent systems that understand visual patterns in fashion. It’s a strong example of my expertise in CNN architecture, model deployment, and image preprocessing pipelines.
